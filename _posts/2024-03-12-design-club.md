Iâ€™m so excited to share my latest project with you!

But first, a question:

What would I do for free? What would I pursue even if it never made me a dollar?

Hereâ€™s my answer:

> I feel most successful when I help my friends succeed.

At work, I call this mentoring. Whatever it is called, I *love* it! I want to be someone that has something to give to his peers, his coworkers, his friends. If I donâ€™t have a skill that someone needs, I can find the person that does and connect them for their mutual success. Thereâ€™s always something I can do to build others and help them along.

This begs the next question: what opportunity would connect me with friends and give us opportunities to grow together? Iâ€™m glad you asked!

## Introducing the â€‹*Small & Simple Design Club*â€‹!
Iâ€™m building a place for me and my friends to gather, share, support, and encourage one another. Itâ€™s called the â€‹*Small & Simple Design Club*â€‹, and itâ€™s going to be great!

How do I know itâ€™s going to be great? Because *you* are going to be part of it!

To start, there are two tiers for membership in the club. One is free: the *Rookie* tier. One is paid: the â€‹*Pro*â€‹ tierâ€‹*.*â€‹ All tiers get access to the Clubâ€™s private Discord server, including the following perks:

- Find fun, like-minded individuals
- Network with professionals 
- Sharpen your skills
- Discover new, exciting job opportunities 
- Share animated gifs
- And more!

## Why is there a paid tier?
The paid tier serves several functions:
- Draw in quality people
- Create commitment to the community
- Help fund greater value: guest lectures, group training, recruiting opportunities, etc.

I have found that in business and in life, quality people make everything better. So, Iâ€™m aiming to draw in quality people and give them real value for their investment. (Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m inviting you - ðŸ˜‰) .
