I love designing t-shirts and selling them on [Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/people/small-simple-things)! Usually, you have to pay money for my t-shirts. Today you can [join my email list](#membedded-subscribe-form) for a chance to win a free t-shirt! Crazy!!! Do it now before I change my mind!

## More details for those who like to read details and aren't sure whether they like getting free stuff

1. Sign up for my email list using the [form below](#membedded-subscribe-form). I promise I won't sell your info. Scout's honor.
1. You will be automatically entered for a chance to win a discount code for a free t-shirt on [Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/).
1. I will hold a random drawing sometime in July/August 2023 to determine the winner.

## But wait! There's more!

You can use [my secret discount code](https://cottonbureau.com/account#/discounts/563783) for $5 off Cotton Bureau products. (Discount is only valid for new Cotton Bureau users).
