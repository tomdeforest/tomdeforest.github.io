I am here to tell you that you are not enough. I know that your Mom, your therapist, and the socials have told you otherwise. You shouldn’t believe them. 

The fact is I’m not enough either. None of us is enough. How long have we been trying to eliminate poverty, crime, and traffic congestion? In all that time, have we fixed any of these things? We have not.

You and I live in an imperfect world. We are imperfect beings. How can we possibly be enough?

“I’m enough for my kids”, you might say. Can you prevent anything bad from ever happening to your children? Can you guarantee they’ll never be poor, that they’ll never make a mistake? Or can you redeem them from sin when they stray?

There is only one being who is enough. That being is Jesus Christ. Miraculously, He is enough for all of us, everywhere, all at once, and forever.

“I am enough”, is not true. Sorry to be a downer. But, we can amend that statement so that it is both true and positive.

“With Jesus Christ, I am enough.”

You’ve been liberated from a falsehood. You’re welcome.
