I am a lifelong in-house designer. But I’ve always admired those who successfully start and run their own business. And I’ve wondered, “Could I do that?”

The answer so far has been, “No, Tom. You cannot start a successful business. You can’t even manage to keep succulents alive.”

Last year, I fell into a rut at work. I have a really good job. I work with great people. I have good benefits. The cause is worthy. But I lost focus and forgot why I’m there.

And so, I decided to make another go at entrepreneurship. This time, to increase my chances of success, I teamed up with a friend of mine to do the free [Start and Grow Your Business program](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/self-reliance/course-materials/starting-and-growing-my-business?lang%253Deng).

Since then, we’ve had video calls once a week. First, we worked through the free program. That gave us valuable insights on determining a viable business model. We also learned the value of inviting God to be a part of our business pursuits. (If you’re new to business like me, I highly recommend the program. It takes a couple hours a week for 2-3 months.)

We completed the course months ago, but we keep calling in each week.  We talk about what we’re learning about business, and what we’re learning about ourselves. To be honest, that last part has been a little painful. For example, by looking back at past freelance work, I can see that I got hung up on money and failed to build good relationships. In some cases, I even damaged friendships. It hurts to admit it, but now that I can see it, I can fix it. In that regard, the ROI on my effort is astronomical.

Where will the journey end? Will I become a successful business owner? I don’t know. What I can say with confidence is this: if I don’t keep going on this journey, then I will be less than I could have otherwise been. Being on this journey with God has changed me for the better. Who knows, if I keep trying maybe I can become successful at business and caring for succulents.

[2 Timothy 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4?lang%253Deng) (KJV) “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”
