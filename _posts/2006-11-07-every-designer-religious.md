I ran into a bug with Internet Explorer today (no surprise). Not only that, there were different bugs for IE 6 and IE 7. I banged my head on the browsers for a while. When I was at a complete loss I said a little prayer asking for help and then read my rss feeds for a little while. When I came back to the problem, I typed a few lines of code, made a few tweaks and voila, problem solved. 

I feel sorry for web developers who don't pray. Internet Explorer is too much of a monster to not seek the help of a higher power (and I don't mean Starbucks).

I transfered this post from my old Wordpress blog. Although technologies have matured, the principle of seeking divince guidance in the details of our lives is more relevant than ever.
