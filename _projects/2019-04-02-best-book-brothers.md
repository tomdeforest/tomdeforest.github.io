<p>The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1369662613" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Best Book Brothers</em> podcast</a> is produced by Joe and Benji Hadfield. They started the podcast as a way to stay connected with each and share their diverse and wandering interests with the wider world. I thoroughly enjoy their quirky sense of humor and intense curiosity, and I'm sure you will, too.</p>
