I love t-shirt design! My idea of a good time is being alone in my studio *in flow* working on a funny t-shirt design. I know, I know. The nerd force is strong with me, but what can I say.

## New Year's Resolution

This year (2023) I made a goal to design and upload one t-shirt a day to my POD (print on demand) shops. Although I love t-shirt design, I'd let it slip away - I didn't do it anymore. I needed a reboot. 

And for once, my resolution actually worked! While I didn't manage to upload a new design everyday, I did spend a little time each day honing my craft. In the end, I managed to upload 19 designs - not bad at all! It got me going and I had a lot of fun.

## Let's Happy Together

I design t-shirts because it makes me happy. I hope it makes others happy. I am delighted when others connect with my designs and purchase tees.

My favorite POD site is [Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/people/small-simple-things?hierarchicalMenu%255Bcategories__lvl0%255D%255B0%255D%253DApparel). The designs are high quality and the customer service is top shelf. If you purchase my tees, post a pic and tag me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/smallandsimplethings.org_/)!
