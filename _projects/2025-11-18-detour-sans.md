Meet Detour Sans—the quirky, hand-drawn font that doesn’t always follow the rules but gets where it’s going in style. Think of it as the free spirit of sans-serifs, a little off the beaten path but always charming. Perfect for when your design needs a dash of fun, a sprinkle of authenticity, and a font that isn’t afraid to take the scenic route.

This font is designed in collaboration with Juna of [Detour Shirts](https://detourshirts.com/). Check out Juna’s shop to see Detour Sans in action and shop his extensive gallery of fun, funny, and fantastic designs!

The font is provided in OTF format for desktop use. See EULA for details. Others uses, such as embedding in websites or PDFs, require a separate license. [Contact me](mailto:hi@smallandsimplethings.org) and I’ll be happy to assist!
