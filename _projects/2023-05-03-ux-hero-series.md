[John Dilworth](/blog/john-dilworth), [Gilbert Lee](/blog/gilbert-lee), and [Paul Mayne](/blog/paul-mayne) are three Utah locals who have shown tremendous ability to lead in the UX and design space. In 2014 when I became a UX manager, I reached out to each of them to understand a little about how they work. I created a series of blog posts to help the lessons sink in and to share what I learned.

They were all friendly and accommodating. I enjoyed the time I spent with them. I learned a lot and enjoyed hearing from others who enjoyed the articles. It's amazing what I could learn by taking a few of my heroes to lunch. Thanks, guys! You're awesome!
