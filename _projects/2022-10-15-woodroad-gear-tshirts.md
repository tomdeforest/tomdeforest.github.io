I've worn Woodroad Gear Co. socks for several years. They are so comfortable and warm. They reached out last fall and asked if I would be interested in creating a few designs. 

The photo at the top is my design that they printed this spring 2023. Below is more of the work I did for them. I went for a "National Parks" kind of vibe. The curvy lines can represent topographic map lines or the grain of the cross-cut wood. The font is Poller One, slightly modified to soften the corners. The new design blends nicely with the exist line of products while still being fresh and new.
