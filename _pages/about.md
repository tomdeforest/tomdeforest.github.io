Welcome to [smallandsimplethings.org](https://www.smallandsimplethings.org)! I'm Tom DeForest, and I'm glad you're here. Through creativity, curiosity, and collaboration I find and amplify good. I alliterate whenever possible.

Here are a few of my areas of interest:

## Family and Genealogy

I am happily married for 25 years. I love my wife and our five daughters. I know a little about my ancestors. I treasure the heritage [they've left me](/project/a-walloon-family-in-america).

## Design

All of my personal and professional pursuits revolve around art and design in one form or another.

- [T-shirt Design]({{site.baseurl}}/project/t-shirt-design)
- Graphic Design
- Visual Identity
- Typography & Fonts
- UX Design
- UI Design
- Copyright and Intellectual Property Law

## Code

This site is built in Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub Codespaces makes it possible for me to edit and preview my site on my iPad. No one is more surprised than me that I figured out how to do this.

- GitHub
- Codespaces
- Docker
- Jekyll
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Japan

I lived as a missionary in Japan for two years. I practice Japanese everyday in Duolingo. I'm still planning my return trip to Japan.

- Language
- Culture
- Travel

I write about these topics on my [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/) and explore them in my [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/).

Maybe you'd like to [collaborate with me](mailto:smallandsimplethings@proton.me) on your next project.
