Welcome to [smallandsimplethings.org](https://www.smallandsimplethings.org)! I'm Tom DeForest, and I'm glad you're here. Through creativity, curiosity, and collaboration I find and amplify good. (I alliterate whenever possible.)

![Small & Simple Design Club]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design-club-membership@2x.png)

First, allow me to introduce you to the [Small & Simple Design Club](https://discord.gg/uTUUXN6djc), a private online community for designers, started in February 2024! This clubâ€™s first mission is to help you, the junior designer, level up your professional chops and start achieving your career goals. I have two decades of experience hiring interns and junior designers. I look forward to helping you launch a successful UI and UX design career. [Join the club](https://discord.gg/uTUUXN6djc) and start getting mentored for FREE!

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>I am happily married for 25+ years. I love my wife and our five daughters. I know a little about my ancestors. I treasure the heritage <a href="/project/a-walloon-family-in-america">they've left to me and my family</a>.</p>

            <h2>Japan</h2>
            <p>I lived as a missionary in Japan for two years. I practice Japanese everyday in Duolingo. <strike>I'm still planning my return trip to Japan.</strike> My wife and I made our dream trip to Japan in Nov 2023! It was awesome! Now I want to go back with my whole family.</p>

            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>This site is built in Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub Codespaces makes it possible for me to edit and preview my site on my iPad. No one is more surprised than me that I figured out how to do this.</p>
